  title: Amadeus Get Cars Search
  description: "With this API you can find out the price and type of car, for all
    car rental providers, in a specified geographical location.\n\nYou can quickly
    see the locations of car providers near a given point, and what cars are available
    to rent, and at what prices. This API is based on our car pricing service that
    gets live availability from car providers, and is used to power a variety of airline
    and travel agency websites.\n           \nResults are validated from car providers,
    and thus response times may take up to 10 seconds (response times are typically
    about 5s), and the number of concurrent calls is throttled per user to avoid flooding
    our provider's systems. However, this means the final result is guaranteed to
    be live and accurate.\n\nThe configuration of this API allows search for car rentals
    in the rental location where the car is picked up (at the start of the rental),
    is the same as the one where it will be dropped off."
